# model-athena-react

This repository is a model where React front-end is included with Athena Framework.

This repository combines the React frontend with the Athena Framework backend. The goal is to provide a simple
model for developing applications in local, build the front and serve the Athena app in production.

## Run in local

To run the frontend in development mode, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

Then, run the backend in another terminal:

```sh
shards run server
```
